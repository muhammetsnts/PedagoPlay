# PedagoPlay

## 1. Project Overview
The goal is to build an AI-powered application that helps parents, teachers, or caregivers find suitable activities and games for children. The app will suggest both indoor and outdoor activities based on:

- Number of child/children  
- Age of the child/children  
- Weather conditions  
- (Optional) Location  
- (Optional) Specific case / special notes (optional)  

The AI should act like a pedagogue, providing developmentally appropriate, safe, responsible, and engaging activities for children according to the special notes (e.g., physical limitations, preferences, or special needs) provided by the user, if any. The interface will be child-friendly and visually appealing.

## 2. Key Features

**User Input Form:**

- Number of children
- Age of the child (required)
- Weather (sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.) (required)
- Location (optional)
- Special notes (optional)

**Activity Suggestions:**

- Indoor activities for bad weather or limited space
- Outdoor activities when conditions are suitable
- Activities tailored to the child’s developmental stage

**AI-Powered Recommendations**

- Use an LLM to act as a pedagogue
- Provide structured suggestions: activity name, short description, required materials, and learning/developmental benefits
- Friendly User Interface
- Cute and playful design (colors, icons, mascots)
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Easy navigation for parents

## 3. Tech Stack
**Backend (Logic & AI Integration):**
- Python (Flask or FastAPI)  
- LLM (e.g., GPT-based model)  

**Frontend (UI/UX):**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Child-friendly design with animations/icons  

**Optional Integrations:**
- Weather API (for real-time conditions)  
- Geolocation API (if user allows)  

## 4. System Architecture
**Frontend:**
- Collects user input (# of children, ages, weather, location)  
- Displays suggested activities  

**Backend:**
- Processes input data  
- Sends prompt to LLM to generate activity suggestions  
- Returns structured results to the frontend  

**Database (Optional):**
- Store pre-defined activities (can complement AI suggestions)  
- Keep activity history for personalization  

## 5. Development Phases
**Phase 1 – Setup**
- Define project scope and requirements  
- Set up backend with Python (Flask/FastAPI)  
- Create a simple frontend form  

**Phase 2 – AI Integration**
- Design pedagogical prompt template for LLM  
- Integrate LLM for activity generation  
- Test different inputs (# of children, ages, weather types)  

**Phase 3 – UI/UX Design**
- Build playful and friendly interface  
- Add icons, animations, and soft colors  
- (Optional) Ensure mobile responsiveness  

**Phase 4 – Testing & Launch**
- Usability testing with parents/educators  
- Refine activity suggestions for safety & pedagogy  
- (Optional) Deploy app (cloud hosting)  

**Phase 5 – Enhancements (Optional)**
- Integrate weather/location APIs  
- Add option to save favorite activities  
- Provide multiple suggestions per input  

## 6. Future Improvements
- Personalization based on child’s preferences and history  
- Voice interaction for accessibility  
- Multi-language support
