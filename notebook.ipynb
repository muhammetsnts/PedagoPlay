Provide safe tools like cookie cutters and rolling pins for them to explore textures and forms.  \\n**Why it\\'s good:** This boosts fine motor skills and creativity, helping preschoolers practice hand-eye coordination while encouraging imaginative play that supports early language development through describing their creations.\\n\\n#### 📚 Indoor Activity 2: Storytime Puppet Show\\nGather household items like socks or paper bags to make simple puppets, then act out a short story like \"The Three Little Pigs\" with the kids taking turns as characters. Keep it to 10-15 minutes to match their attention spans.  \\n**Why it\\'s good:** It enhances social-emotional skills by promoting empathy through role-playing, while building vocabulary and listening abilities in a fun, interactive way.\\n\\n#### 🌳 Outdoor Activity 1: Park Scavenger Hunt\\nHead to Parc de Mon Repos or a nearby green space in Lausanne—gather leaves, sticks, and flowers (safely, without picking protected plants) as part of a simple hunt for \"red things\" or \"crunchy textures.\" Use a picture list to guide them.  \\n**Why it\\'s good:** This encourages gross motor movement and observation skills, connecting kids to nature and teaching basic science concepts like colors and textures in an exploratory, sibling-bonding adventure.\\n\\n#### 🚶 Outdoor Activity 2: Lakeside Nature Walk\\nStroll along the Ouchy promenade by Lake Geneva, pointing out ducks, boats, and pebbles to collect (in a small bucket). Stop for a picnic snack and let them splash gently in shallow water if supervised.  \\n**Why it\\'s good:** It supports physical development through walking and balance, while sparking wonder about the environment, fostering sensory awareness and early conversations about the world around them.'"
